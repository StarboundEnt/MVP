# UX Copy: Response Card, Chips, Status Lines, Crisis Flow

## Response Card (What Matters + Next Step)
Structure:
1) What matters (1 short sentence)
2) Next step (1 short sentence)

Examples:
- "You are under time pressure and low energy. Pick the smallest step that reduces friction today."
- "This feels tangled and tied to work and money. Start by choosing one constraint you can change this week."
- "You want clarity before deciding. The fastest next step is to compare two options side by side."

Validation (optional, brief, non-clinical):
- "That is a lot to carry."
- "It makes sense this feels heavy."
- "This is a hard spot to be in."

## Clarifying Question Copy
- "What feels most urgent: relief now, or a plan for later?"
- "Is the main blocker time, money, or energy?"
- "Do you want a quick next step or a fuller plan?"

## Option Comparison Copy
- "Here are two paths. Pick the one that fits your bandwidth."
- "Option A trades speed for stability. Option B trades certainty for flexibility."

## Concrete Next Step Copy
- "Do the smallest useful action first."
- "Make it easier to start: set a 10-minute timer and stop when it ends."
- "If it helps, choose one of these: [option list]."

## Gentle Reflection Copy
- "A lot of this is about control vs. uncertainty."
- "There is a pattern of carrying this alone."

## Pattern Recall Copy (when memory is used)
- "This theme has come up a few times recently: [high-level theme]."
- "Last time this showed up, sleep and money were big factors."

## Action Chips (2-3 max)
Labels:
- "Clarify"
- "Save"
- "Get support"
- "Show options"
- "Make a plan"

Microcopy (optional tooltip/secondary):
- "Answer a quick question"
- "Log this entry"
- "Loop someone in"

## Status Lines (only when relevant)
- "Saved to Journal"
- "Using past entries to personalize this"
- "Not medical advice"

## Why This? Drawer
Title:
- "Why this?"

Sections:
- "Signals picked up"
- "What was remembered"
- "Change what is remembered"

Example lines:
- "Signals: low energy, high time pressure, access constraint"
- "Remembered: work stress + sleep disruption (last 2 weeks)"
- "Edit memory"

## Support Escalation Copy
### Tier 1 (gentle prompt)
- "Would it help to loop someone in?"
- "If you want, pick one person to involve."

### Tier 2 (stronger guidance)
- "This is worth real-time support."
- "Choose one: trusted person, professional support, or local resources."

### Tier 3 (crisis flow)
- "If you are in immediate danger, call emergency services now."
- "If you might harm yourself or someone else, contact a crisis line now."
- "If possible, reach out to a trusted person right away."

Notes:
- Keep tone calm, direct, and non-alarming.
- Avoid hedging ("maybe", "if you want") in Tier 3.
